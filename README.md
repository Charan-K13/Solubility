# Solubility_Prediction_ML

## Project Focus:
* The project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the solubility of chemical compounds in water, using their molecular structures represented as SMILES string.
* The molecular descriptors calculations are carried out using RDkit.
* Supervised learning algorithms are used to develop a robust prediction model.

## Introduction to the property:
Solubility is the ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent to form a homogeneous solution at a given temperature and pressure. It is a fundamental physicochemical property that influences drug absorption, distribution, chemical reactivity and formulation. It is usually expressed in terms of grams per liter (gm/L), molarity (mol/L) or percentage.
Predicting solubility helps in:
* Drug development
* Designing chemical processes
* Environmental risk assessment
